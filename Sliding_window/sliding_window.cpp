1) Maximum Sum of Distinct Subarrays With Length K:
you are given an integer array nums and an integer k. Find the maximum subarray sum of all the 
subarrays of nums that meet the following conditions:
The length of the subarray is k, and
All the elements of the subarray are distinct.
Return the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the conditions. If no subarray meets the conditions, return 0.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,5,4,2,9,9,9], k = 3
Output: 15
Explanation: The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
- [1,5,4] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 10.
- [5,4,2] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 11.
- [4,2,9] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 15.
- [2,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
- [9,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
We return 15 because it is the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the conditions














-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Sliding Subarray Beauty
 Given an integer array nums containing n integers, find the beauty of each subarray of size k.

The beauty of a subarray is the xth smallest integer in the subarray if it is negative, or 0 if there are fewer than x negative integers.

Return an integer array containing n - k + 1 integers, which denote the beauty of the subarrays in order from the first index in the array.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,-1,-3,-2,3], k = 3, x = 2
Output: [-1,-2,-2]
Explanation: There are 3 subarrays with size k = 3. 
The first subarray is [1, -1, -3] and the 2nd smallest negative integer is -1. 
The second subarray is [-1, -3, -2] and the 2nd smallest negative integer is -2. 
The third subarray is [-3, -2, 3] and the 2nd smallest negative integer is -2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5], k = 2, x = 2
Output: [-1,-2,-3,-4]
Explanation: There are 4 subarrays with size k = 2.
For [-1, -2], the 2nd smallest negative integer is -1.
For [-2, -3], the 2nd smallest negative integer is -2.
For [-3, -4], the 2nd smallest negative integer is -3.
For [-4, -5], the 2nd smallest negative integer is -4. 
Example 3:

Input: nums = [-3,1,2,-3,0,-3], k = 2, x = 1
Output: [-3,0,-3,-3,-3]
Explanation: There are 5 subarrays with size k = 2.
For [-3, 1], the 1st smallest negative integer is -3.
For [1, 2], there is no negative integer so the beauty is 0.
For [2, -3], the 1st smallest negative integer is -3.
For [-3, 0], the 1st smallest negative integer is -3.
For [0, -3], the 1st smallest negative integer is -3.







--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3)  Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards
There are several cards arranged in a row, and each card has an associated number of points. The points are given in the integer array cardPoints.

In one step, you can take one card from the beginning or from the end of the row. You have to take exactly k cards.

Your score is the sum of the points of the cards you have taken.

Given the integer array cardPoints and the integer k, return the maximum score you can obtain.

 

Example 1:

Input: cardPoints = [1,2,3,4,5,6,1], k = 3
Output: 12
Explanation: After the first step, your score will always be 1. However, choosing the rightmost card first will maximize your total score. The optimal strategy is to take the three cards on the right, giving a final score of 1 + 6 + 5 = 12.
Example 2:

Input: cardPoints = [2,2,2], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Regardless of which two cards you take, your score will always be 4.
Example 3:

Input: cardPoints = [9,7,7,9,7,7,9], k = 7
Output: 55
Explanation: You have to take all the cards. Your score is the sum of points of all cards.
 






-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Maximum Average Subarray I
You are given an integer array nums consisting of n elements, and an integer k.

Find a contiguous subarray whose length is equal to k that has the maximum average value and return this value. Any answer with a calculation error less than 10-5 will be accepted.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4
Output: 12.75000
Explanation: Maximum average is (12 - 5 - 6 + 50) / 4 = 51 / 4 = 12.75
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5], k = 1
Output: 5.00000


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) Number of Sub-arrays of Size K and Average Greater than or Equal to Threshold
Given an array of integers arr and two integers k and threshold, return the number of sub-arrays of size k and average greater than or equal to threshold.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [2,2,2,2,5,5,5,8], k = 3, threshold = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: Sub-arrays [2,5,5],[5,5,5] and [5,5,8] have averages 4, 5 and 6 respectively. All other sub-arrays of size 3 have averages less than 4 (the threshold).
Example 2:

Input: arr = [11,13,17,23,29,31,7,5,2,3], k = 3, threshold = 5
Output: 6
Explanation: The first 6 sub-arrays of size 3 have averages greater than 5. Note that averages are not integers.




---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6) Check If a String Contains All Binary Codes of Size K
Given a binary string s and an integer k, return true if every binary code of length k is a substring of s. Otherwise, return false.

Example 1:

Input: s = "00110110", k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: The binary codes of length 2 are "00", "01", "10" and "11". They can be all found as substrings at indices 0, 1, 3 and 2 respectively.
Example 2:

Input: s = "0110", k = 1
Output: true
Explanation: The binary codes of length 1 are "0" and "1", it is clear that both exist as a substring. 
Example 3:

Input: s = "0110", k = 2
Output: false
Explanation: The binary code "00" is of length 2 and does not exist in the array.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7) Find All Anagrams in a String
Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:
Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
Output: [0,6]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
Example 2:

Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
Output: [0,1,2]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab". 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8) Permutation in String
Given two strings s1 and s2, return true if s2 contains a permutation of s1, or false otherwise.

In other words, return true if one of s1's permutations is the substring of s2.

Example 1:

Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidbaooo"
Output: true
Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").
Example 2:

Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidboaoo"
Output: false


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9) Substrings of Size Three with Distinct Characters
A string is good if there are no repeated characters.

Given a string s​​​​​, return the number of good substrings of length three in s​​​​​​.

Note that if there are multiple occurrences of the same substring, every occurrence should be counted.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

Example 1:
Input: s = "xyzzaz"
Output: 1
Explanation: There are 4 substrings of size 3: "xyz", "yzz", "zza", and "zaz". 
The only good substring of length 3 is "xyz".
Example 2:

Input: s = "aababcabc"
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 7 substrings of size 3: "aab", "aba", "bab", "abc", "bca", "cab", and "abc".
The good substrings are "abc", "bca", "cab", and "abc".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10) Find the Longest Semi-Repetitive Substring
You are given a digit string s that consists of digits from 0 to 9.
A string is called semi-repetitive if there is at most one adjacent pair of the same digit. For example, "0010", "002020", "0123", "2002", and "54944" are semi-repetitive while the following are not: "00101022" (adjacent same digit pairs are 00 and 22), and "1101234883" (adjacent same digit pairs are 11 and 88).
Return the length of the longest semi-repetitive 
substring
 of s.

Example 1:
Input: s = "52233"
Output: 4
Explanation:
The longest semi-repetitive substring is "5223". Picking the whole string "52233" has two adjacent same digit pairs 22 and 33, but at most one is allowed.

Example 2:
Input: s = "5494"
Output: 4
Explanation:
s is a semi-repetitive string.

Example 3:
Input: s = "1111111"
Output: 2
Explanation:
The longest semi-repetitive substring is "11". Picking the substring "111" has two adjacent same digit pairs, but at most one is allowed.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11) Count the Number of Good Subarrays
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the number of good subarrays of nums.

A subarray arr is good if it there are at least k pairs of indices (i, j) such that i < j and arr[i] == arr[j].

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], k = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: The only good subarray is the array nums itself.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,4,3,2,2,4], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 different good subarrays:
- [3,1,4,3,2,2] that has 2 pairs.
- [3,1,4,3,2,2,4] that has 3 pairs.
- [1,4,3,2,2,4] that has 2 pairs.
- [4,3,2,2,4] that has 2 pairs.
 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
12) Minimum Consecutive Cards to Pick Up
You are given an integer array cards where cards[i] represents the value of the ith card. A pair of cards are matching if the cards have the same value.

Return the minimum number of consecutive cards you have to pick up to have a pair of matching cards among the picked cards. If it is impossible to have matching cards, return -1.

Example 1:
Input: cards = [3,4,2,3,4,7]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can pick up the cards [3,4,2,3] which contain a matching pair of cards with value 3. Note that picking up the cards [4,2,3,4] is also optimal.
Example 2:
Input: cards = [1,0,5,3]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no way to pick up a set of consecutive cards that contain a pair of matching cards.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
15) Fruit Into Baskets
You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array fruits where fruits[i] is the type of fruit the ith tree produces.

You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:

You only have two baskets, and each basket can only hold a single type of fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick exactly one fruit from every tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.
Given the integer array fruits, return the maximum number of fruits you can pick.

Example 1:
Input: fruits = [1,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from all 3 trees.
Example 2:

Input: fruits = [0,1,2,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from trees [1,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [0,1].
Example 3:

Input: fruits = [1,2,3,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can pick from trees [2,3,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [1,2].

Explanation: The 8 subarrays that have product less than 100 are:
[10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6]
Note that [10, 5, 2] is not included as the product of 100 is not strictly less than k.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 0
Output: 0
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18) Minimum Size Subarray Sum
