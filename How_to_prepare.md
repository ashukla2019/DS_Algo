DSA Topics 
    Data Structures:  
        Linear: Array, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, Hash tables
        Non Linear: Tree, BST, HEAPS, Graphs, Trie

    Algorithms: Sorting, Binary Search, Bit manipulation, Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level order, DFS, BFS
                Topological sort, Dijkstra, Bellman ford

    Problem Solving techniques: Two pointers, Sliding window, Prefix sum, Fast & slow pointers, Divide & Conquer, Greedy,                                       Recursion, Backtracking, Dynamic Programming, Top K elements
      
    Right Order to learn DSA:
    Array -> Linkedlist -> Stack&Queue -> Hash Tables -> Two pointers/Sliding windowd -> Recursion/Backtracking ->
    sorting -> Searching -> Bit Manipulation -> tree/BST/Trie -> Heaps -> Greedy -> Dynamic programming -> Graph
