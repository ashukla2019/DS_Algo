Problem Statement: Given an array of integers arr[] and an integer target.
1st variant: Return YES if there exist two numbers such that their sum is equal to the target. 
Otherwise, return NO.
2nd variant: Return indices of the two numbers such that their sum is equal to the target. 
Otherwise, we will return {-1, -1}.
Example 1:
Input Format: N = 5, arr[] = {2,6,5,8,11}, target = 14
Result: YES (for 1st variant)
       [1, 3] (for 2nd variant)
Explanation: arr[1] + arr[3] = 14. So, the answer is “YES” for the first variant and [1, 3] for 2nd variant.

Example 2:
Input Format: N = 5, arr[] = {2,6,5,8,11}, target = 15
Result: NO (for 1st variant)
	[-1, -1] (for 2nd variant)
Explanation: There exist no such two numbers whose sum is equal to the target.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
string twoSum(int n, vector<int> &arr, int target) {
    sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    int left = 0, right = n - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = arr[left] + arr[right];
        if (sum == target) {
            return "YES";
        }
        else if (sum < target) left++;
        else right--;
    }
    return "NO";
}
Time Complexity: O(N) + O(N*logN), where N = size of the array.
Reason: The loop will run at most N times. And sorting the array will take N*logN time complexity.
Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.

2nd variant: Return indices of the two numbers such that their sum is equal to the target. 
Otherwise, we will return {-1, -1}.
