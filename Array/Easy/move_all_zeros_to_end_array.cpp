Example 1:
Input: 1 ,0 ,2 ,3 ,0 ,4 ,0 ,1
Output: 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,1 ,0 ,0 ,0
Explanation: All the zeros are moved to the end and non-negative integers are moved to front by maintaining order

Example 2:
Input: 1,2,0,1,0,4,0
Output: 1,2,1,4,0,0,0
Explanation: All the zeros are moved to the end and non-negative integers are moved to front by maintaining order
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
vector<int> moveZeros(int n, vector<int> a) {
    int j = -1;
    //place the pointer j:
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (a[i] == 0) {
            j = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    //no non-zero elements:
    if (j == -1) return a;

    //Move the pointers i and j
    //and swap accordingly:
    for (int i = j + 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (a[i] != 0) {
            swap(a[i], a[j]);
            j++;
        }
    }
    return a;
}
Time Complexity: O(N), N = size of the array.
Reason: We have used 2 loops and using those loops, we are basically traversing the array once.
Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space to solve this problem.
