Problem Statement: This problem has 3 variations. They are stated below:
Variation 1: Given row number r and column number c. Print the element at position (r, c) in Pascal’s triangle.
Variation 2: Given the row number n. Print the n-th row of Pascal’s triangle.
Variation 3: Given the number of rows n. Print the first n rows of Pascal’s triangle.

In Pascal’s triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly. 

Naive Approach
In this case, we are given the row number r and the column number c, and we need to find out the element at position (r,c). 
One of the Naive approaches is to generate the entire Pascal triangle and then find the element at position (r,c). We will discuss in variation 3 how to generate Pascal’s triangle.
We have an easier formula to find out the element i.e. r-1Cc-1. Let’s try to analyze the formula to find the value of the combination assuming r-1 as n and c-1 as r:
nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!) 

Calculating the value of nCr:
Naive Approach: 
We can separately calculate n!, r!, (n-r)! and using their values we can calculate nCr. This is an extremely naive way to calculate. The time complexity will be O(n)+O(r)+O(n-r)  


  
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int nCr(int n, int r) {
    long long res = 1;

    // calculating nCr:
    for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
        res = res * (n - i);
        res = res / (i + 1);
    }
    return res;
}

int pascalTriangle(int r, int c) {
    int element = nCr(r - 1, c - 1);
    return element;
}

int main()
{
    int r = 5; // row number
    int c = 3; // col number
    int element = pascalTriangle(r, c);
    cout << "The element at position (r,c) is: "
            << element << "n";
    return 0;
}

Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(c), where c = given column number.
Reason: We are running a loop for r times, where r is c-1.

Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.
