Problem Statement: You are given a read-only array of N integers with values also in the range [1, N] both inclusive. 
Each integer appears exactly once except A which appears twice and B which is missing. The task is to find the repeating and missing numbers 
A and B where A repeats twice and B is missing.
Example 1:
Input Format:  array[] = {3,1,2,5,3}
Result: {3,4)
Explanation: A = 3 , B = 4 
Since 3 is appearing twice and 4 is missing

Example 2:
Input Format: array[] = {3,1,2,5,4,6,7,5}
Result: {5,8)
Explanation: A = 5 , B = 8 
Since 5 is appearing twice and 8 is missing

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<int> findMissingRepeatingNumbers(vector<int> a) {
    int n = a.size(); // size of the array
    int repeating = -1, missing = -1;

    //Find the repeating and missing number:
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        //Count the occurrences:
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (a[j] == i) cnt++;
        }

        if (cnt == 2) repeating = i;
        else if (cnt == 0) missing = i;

        if (repeating != -1 && missing != -1)
            break;
    }
    return {repeating, missing};
}

int main()
{
    vector<int> a = {3, 1, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 5};
    vector<int> ans = findMissingRepeatingNumbers(a);
    cout << "The repeating and missing numbers are: {"
         << ans[0] << ", " << ans[1] << "}\n";
    return 0;
}

Time Complexity: O(N2), where N = size of the given array.
Reason: Here, we are using nested loops to count occurrences of every element between 1 to N.
Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.

Approach:
Assume the repeating number to be X and the missing number to be Y.
The steps are as follows:
First, find out the values of S and Sn and then calculate S – Sn (Using the above formulas).
Then, find out the values of S2 and S2n and then calculate S2 – S2n.
After performing steps 1 and 2, we will be having the values of X + Y and X – Y. Now, by substitution of values, we can easily find the values of X and Y.




#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<int> findMissingRepeatingNumbers(vector<int> a) {
    long long n = a.size(); // size of the array

    // Find Sn and S2n:
    long long SN = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
    long long S2N = (n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) / 6;

    // Calculate S and S2:
    long long S = 0, S2 = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        S += a[i];
        S2 += (long long)a[i] * (long long)a[i];
    }

    //S-Sn = X-Y:
    long long val1 = S - SN;

    // S2-S2n = X^2-Y^2:
    long long val2 = S2 - S2N;

    //Find X+Y = (X^2-Y^2)/(X-Y):
    val2 = val2 / val1;

    //Find X and Y: X = ((X+Y)+(X-Y))/2 and Y = X-(X-Y),
    // Here, X-Y = val1 and X+Y = val2:
    long long x = (val1 + val2) / 2;
    long long y = x - val1;

    return {(int)x, (int)y};
}

int main()
{
    vector<int> a = {3, 1, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 5};
    vector<int> ans = findMissingRepeatingNumbers(a);
    cout << "The repeating and missing numbers are: {"
         << ans[0] << ", " << ans[1] << "}\n";
    return 0;
}
Time Complexity: O(N), where N = the size of the given array.
Reason: We are using only one loop running for N times. So, the time complexity will be O(N).
Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space to solve this problem.
