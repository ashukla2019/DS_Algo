Problem Statement: Given an array of integers arr[] and an integer target.
1st variant: Return YES if there exist two numbers such that their sum is equal to the target. Otherwise, return NO.
2nd variant: Return indices of the two numbers such that their sum is equal to the target. Otherwise, we will return {-1, -1}.

Example 1:
Input Format: N = 5, arr[] = {2,6,5,8,11}, target = 14
Result: YES (for 1st variant)
       [1, 3] (for 2nd variant)
Explanation: arr[1] + arr[3] = 14. So, the answer is “YES” for the first variant and [1, 3] for 2nd variant.

Example 2:
Input Format: N = 5, arr[] = {2,6,5,8,11}, target = 15
Result: NO (for 1st variant)
	[-1, -1] (for 2nd variant)
Explanation: There exist no such two numbers whose sum is equal to the target.

Brute_Force Approach:
First, we will use a loop(say i) to select the indices of the array one by one.
For every index i, we will traverse through the remaining array using another loop(say j) to find the other number 
such that the sum is equal to the target (i.e. arr[i] + arr[j] = target).
Code:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

string twoSum(int n, vector<int> &arr, int target) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (arr[i] + arr[j] == target) return "YES";
        }
    }
    return "NO";
}

int main()
{
    int n = 5;
    vector<int> arr = {2, 6, 5, 8, 11};
    int target = 14;
    string ans = twoSum(n, arr, target);
    cout << "This is the answer for variant 1: " << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}
Time Complexity: O(N2), where N = size of the array.
Reason: There are two loops(i.e. nested) each running for approximately N times.
Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space

Code Variant 2:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<int> twoSum(int n, vector<int> &arr, int target) {
    vector<int> ans;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (arr[i] + arr[j] == target) {
                ans.push_back(i);
                ans.push_back(j);
                return ans;
            }
        }
    }
    return { -1, -1};
}

int main()
{
    int n = 5;
    vector<int> arr = {2, 6, 5, 8, 11};
    int target = 14;
    vector<int> ans = twoSum(n, arr, target);
    cout << "This is the answer for variant 2: [" << ans[0] << ", "
         << ans[1] << "]" << endl;
    return 0;
}
Time Complexity: O(N2), where N = size of the array.
Reason: There are two loops(i.e. nested) each running for approximately N times.
Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Better Approach(using Hashing):   
We will select the element of the array one by one using a loop(say i).
Then we will check if the other required element(i.e. target-arr[i]) exists in the hashMap.
If that element exists, then we will return “YES” for the first variant or we will return the current index i.e. i, and the index of the element found using map i.e. mp[target-arr[i]].
If that element does not exist, then we will just store the current element in the hashMap along with its index. Because in the future, the current element might be a part of our answer.
Finally, if we are out of the loop, that means there is no such pair whose sum is equal to the target. In this case, we will return either “NO” or {-1, -1} as per the variant of the question.  
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

string twoSum(int n, vector<int> &arr, int target) {
    unordered_map<int, int> mpp;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int num = arr[i];
        int moreNeeded = target - num;
        if (mpp.find(moreNeeded) != mpp.end()) {
            return "YES";
        }
        mpp[num] = i;
    }
    return "NO";
}

int main()
{
    int n = 5;
    vector<int> arr = {2, 6, 5, 8, 11};
    int target = 14;
    string ans = twoSum(n, arr, target);
    cout << "This is the answer for variant 1: " << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}  
Time Complexity: O(N), where N = size of the array.
Reason: The loop runs N times in the worst case and searching in a hashmap takes O(1) generally. So the time complexity is O(N).
Note: In the worst case(which rarely happens), the unordered_map takes O(N) to find an element. In that case, the time complexity will be O(N2). If we use map instead of unordered_map, the time complexity will be O(N* logN) as the map data structure takes logN time to find an element.
Space Complexity: O(N) as we use the map data structure.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optimized Approach(using two-pointer): 
We will sort the given array first.
Now, we will take two pointers i.e. left, which points to the first index, and right, which points to the last index.
Now using a loop we will check the sum of arr[left] and arr[right] until left < right.
If arr[left] + arr[right] > sum, we will decrement the right pointer.
If arr[left] + arr[right] < sum, we will increment the left pointer.
If arr[left] + arr[right] == sum, we will return the result.
Finally, if no results are found we will return “No” or {-1, -1}.
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

string twoSum(int n, vector<int> &arr, int target) {
    sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    int left = 0, right = n - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = arr[left] + arr[right];
        if (sum == target) {
            return "YES";
        }
        else if (sum < target) left++;
        else right--;
    }
    return "NO";
}

int main()
{
    int n = 5;
    vector<int> arr = {2, 6, 5, 8, 11};
    int target = 14;
    string ans = twoSum(n, arr, target);
    cout << "This is the answer for variant 1: " << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}
Time Complexity: O(N) + O(N*logN), where N = size of the array.
Reason: The loop will run at most N times. And sorting the array will take N*logN time complexity.
Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.
