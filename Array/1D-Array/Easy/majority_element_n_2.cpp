Problem Statement: Given an array of N integers, write a program to return an element that occurs more than N/2 times in the given array.
You may consider that such an element always exists in the array.
Example 1:
Input Format: N = 3, nums[] = {3,2,3}
Result: 3
Explanation: When we just count the occurrences of each number and compare with half of the size of the array, you will get 3 for the above solution. 

Example 2:
Input Format:  N = 7, nums[] = {2,2,1,1,1,2,2}

Result: 2

Explanation: After counting the number of times each element appears and comparing it with half of array size, we get 2 as result.

Example 3:
Input Format:  N = 10, nums[] = {4,4,2,4,3,4,4,3,2,4}

Result: 4

Using map data structure:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int majorityElement(vector<int> v) {

    //size of the given array:
    int n = v.size();

    //declaring a map:
    map<int, int> mpp;

    //storing the elements with its occurnce:
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        mpp[v[i]]++;
    }

    //searching for the majority element:
    for (auto it : mpp) {
        if (it.second > (n / 2)) {
            return it.first;
        }
    }

    return -1;
}

int main()
{
    vector<int> arr = {2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2};
    int ans = majorityElement(arr);
    cout << "The majority element is: " << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}
Time Complexity: O(N*logN) + O(N), where N = size of the given array.
Reason: We are using a map data structure. Insertion in the map takes logN time. And we are doing it for N elements. So, it results in the first term O(N*logN). The second O(N) is for checking which element occurs more than floor(N/2) times. If we use unordered_map instead, the first term will be O(N) for the best and average case and for the worst case, it will be O(N2).
Space Complexity: O(N) as we are using a map data structure.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optimal Approach: Moore’s Voting Algorithm:
Intuition:
If the array contains a majority element, its occurrence must be greater than the floor(N/2). Now, we can say that the count of minority elements and majority elements is equal up to a certain point in the array. So when we traverse through the array we try to keep track of the count of elements and the element itself for which we are tracking the count. 

After traversing the whole array, we will check the element stored in the variable. If the question states that the array must contain a majority element, the stored element will be that one but if the question does not state so, then we need to check if the stored element is the majority element or not. If not, then the array does not contain any majority element.
Approach: 
Initialize 2 variables:
Count –  for tracking the count of element
Element – for which element we are counting
Traverse through the given array.
If Count is 0 then store the current element of the array as Element.
If the current element and Element are the same increase the Count by 1.
If they are different decrease the Count by 1.
The integer present in Element should be the result we are expecting   



#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int majorityElement(vector<int> v) {

    //size of the given array:
    int n = v.size();
    int cnt = 0; // count
    int el; // Element

    //applying the algorithm:
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (cnt == 0) {
            cnt = 1;
            el = v[i];
        }
        else if (el == v[i]) cnt++;
        else cnt--;
    }

    //checking if the stored element
    // is the majority element:
    int cnt1 = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (v[i] == el) cnt1++;
    }

    if (cnt1 > (n / 2)) return el;
    return -1;
}

int main()
{
    vector<int> arr = {2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2};
    int ans = majorityElement(arr);
    cout << "The majority element is: " << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}
Time Complexity: O(N) + O(N), where N = size of the given array.
Reason: The first O(N) is to calculate the count and find the expected majority element. The second one is to check if the expected element is the majority one or not.
Note: If the question states that the array must contain a majority element, in that case, we do not need the second check. Then the time complexity will boil down to O(N).
Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.
