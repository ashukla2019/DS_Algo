Cheat Sheet
Algorithm	       Best Case	      Average Case	   Worst Case	   Space Complexity	   When to Use
Quick Sort	     O(n log n)	      O(n log n)	     O(n^2)	       O(log n)	           When average case performance is important
Merge Sort	     O(n log n)	      O(n log n)	     O(n log n)	   O(n)	               When stability and worst-case performance are more important than memory usage
Heap Sort	       O(n log n)	      O(n log n)	     O(n log n)	   O(1)	               When memory is a concern, and worst-case performance is important
Insertion Sort	 O(n)	            O(n^2)	         O(n^2)	       O(1)	               When the input is small or nearly sorted
Bubble Sort	     O(n)             O(n^2)	         O(n^2)	       O(1)	               When the input is small or nearly sorted
Selection Sort	 O(n^2)	          O(n^2)	         O(n^2)	       O(1)	               When memory is a concern, and the input is small
Counting Sort	   O(n + k)	        O(n + k)	       O(n + k)	     O(n + k)	           When the range of potential items (k) is known and not too large
