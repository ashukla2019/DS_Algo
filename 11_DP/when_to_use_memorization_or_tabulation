In dynamic programming, both memoization and tabulation are used to optimize recursive solutions by storing and reusing previously computed results. Tabulation is generally preferred when all subproblems must be solved, as it's iterative and avoids the overhead of recursion. Memoization, on the other hand, is more suitable when only certain subproblems need to be solved, as it can be more efficient in such cases
