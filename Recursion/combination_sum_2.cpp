Problem Statement: Given a collection of candidate numbers (candidates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sum to target. Each number in candidates may only be used once in the combination.
Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

Example 1:
Input: candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5], target = 8
Output: 
[
[1,1,6],
[1,2,5],
[1,7],
[2,6]]
Explanation: These are the unique combinations whose sum is equal to target.
 
Example 2:
Input: candidates = [2,5,2,1,2], target = 5
Output: [[1,2,2],[5]]
Explanation: These are the unique combinations whose sum is equal to target.

Solution 1: Using extra space and time complexity 
Approach:
Defining the Recursive Function:
Base Condition:Whenever the target value is zero add the ds to the ans return.
#include<bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;
void findCombination(int ind, int target, vector < int > & arr, vector < vector < int >> & ans, vector < int > & ds) {
  if (target == 0) {
    ans.push_back(ds);
    return;
  }
  for (int i = ind; i < arr.size(); i++) {
    if (i > ind && arr[i] == arr[i - 1]) continue;
    if (arr[i] > target) break;
    ds.push_back(arr[i]);
    findCombination(i + 1, target - arr[i], arr, ans, ds);
    ds.pop_back();
  }
}
vector < vector < int >> combinationSum2(vector < int > & candidates, int target) {
  sort(candidates.begin(), candidates.end());
  vector < vector < int >> ans;
  vector < int > ds;
  findCombination(0, target, candidates, ans, ds);
  return ans;
}
int main() {
  vector<int> v{10,1,2,7,6,1,5};
  vector < vector < int >> comb = combinationSum2(v, 8);
  cout << "[ ";
  for (int i = 0; i < comb.size(); i++) {
    cout << "[ ";
    for (int j = 0; j < comb[i].size(); j++) {
      cout << comb[i][j] << " ";
    }
    cout << "]";
  }
  cout << " ]";
}
Output:

[ [ 1 1 6 ][ 1 2 5 ][ 1 7 ][ 2 6 ] ]
Time Complexity:O(2^n*k)
Reason: Assume if all the elements in the array are unique then the no. of subsequence you will get will be O(2^n). we also add the ds to our ans when we reach the base case that will take “k”//average space for the ds.
Space Complexity:O(k*x)
Reason: if we have x combinations then space will be x*k where k is the average length of the combination.
