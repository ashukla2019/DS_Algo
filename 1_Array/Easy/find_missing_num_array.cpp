Example 1:
Input Format: N = 5, array[] = {1,2,4,5}
Result: 3
Explanation: In the given array, number 3 is missing. So, 3 is the answer.

Example 2:
Input Format: N = 3, array[] = {1,3}
Result: 2
Explanation: In the given array, number 2 is missing. So, 2 is the answer.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 int missingNumber(vector<int>&a, int N) {

    //Summation of first N numbers:
    int sum = (N * (N + 1)) / 2;

    //Summation of all array elements:
    int s2 = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {
        s2 += a[i];
    }

    int missingNum = sum - s2;
    return missingNum;
}
Time Complexity: O(N), where N = size of array+1.
Reason: Here, we need only 1 loop to get the sum of the array elements. The loop runs for approx. N times. So, the time complexity is O(N).
Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.
