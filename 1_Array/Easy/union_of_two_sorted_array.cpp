Example 1:
Input:
n = 5,m = 5.
arr1[] = {1,2,3,4,5}  
arr2[] = {2,3,4,4,5}
Output:
 {1,2,3,4,5}

Explanation: 
Common Elements in arr1 and arr2  are:  2,3,4,5
Distnict Elements in arr1 are : 1
Distnict Elemennts in arr2 are : No distinct elements.
Union of arr1 and arr2 is {1,2,3,4,5} 

Example 2:
Input:
n = 10,m = 7.
arr1[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
arr2[] = {2,3,4,4,5,11,12}
Output: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}
Explanation: 
Common Elements in arr1 and arr2  are:  2,3,4,5
Distnict Elements in arr1 are : 1,6,7,8,9,10
Distnict Elemennts in arr2 are : 11,12
Union of arr1 and arr2 is {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12} 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
vector < int > FindUnion(int arr1[], int arr2[], int n, int m) {

  vector < int > Union;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    freq[arr1[i]]++;

Output:
Union of arr1 and arr2 is

Complexity Analysis
Time Compleixty : O( (m+n)log(m+n) ) . Inserting a key in map takes logN times, where N is no of elements in map. At max map can store m+n elements {when there are no common elements and elements in arr,arr2 are distntict}. So Inserting m+n th element takes log(m+n) time. Upon approximation across insertion of all elements in worst it would take O((m+n)log(m+n) time.
Using HashMap also takes the same time, On average insertion in unordered_map takes O(1) time but sorting the union vector takes O((m+n)log(m+n))  time. Because at max union vector can have m+n elements.
Space Complexity : O(m+n) {If Space of Union ArrayList is considered} 
O(1) {If Space of union ArrayList is not considered}
