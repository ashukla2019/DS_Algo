Problem Statement: Given an array of N integers. Find the elements that appear more than
N/3 times in the array. If no such element exists, return an empty vector.
Example 1:
Input Format: N = 5, array[] = {1,2,2,3,2}
Result: 2
Explanation: Here we can see that the Count(1) = 1, Count(2) = 3 and Count(3) = 1.Therefore, the count of 2 is greater than N/3 times. Hence, 2 is the answer.

Example 2:
Input Format:  N = 6, array[] = {11,33,33,11,33,11}
Result: 11 33
Explanation: Here we can see that the Count(11) = 3 and Count(33) = 3. Therefore, the count of both 11 and 33 is greater than N/3 times. Hence, 11 and 33 is the answer.  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------    

Approach:  N = 6, array[] = {11,33,33,11,33,11}
majority element would be n/3+1 => 6/3+1 = 3
max 2 elements would be majority elements: 3 + 3    
we will store key,pair in map and also will check if count is 3 or not. if count 3 add it in answer.
if size of vector becomes 2 means we got our result. break the for loop.    

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<int> majorityElement(vector<int> v) {
    int n = v.size(); //size of the array
    vector<int> ls; // list of answers

    //declaring a map:
    map<int, int> mpp;

    // least occurrence of the majority element:
    int mini = int(n / 3) + 1;

    //storing the elements with its occurnce:
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        mpp[v[i]]++;

        //checking if v[i] is
        // the majority element:
        if (mpp[v[i]] == mini) {
            ls.push_back(v[i]);
        }
        if (ls.size() == 2) break;
    }

    return ls;
}

int main()
{
    vector<int> arr = {11, 33, 33, 11, 33, 11};
    vector<int> ans = majorityElement(arr);
    cout << "The majority elements are: ";
    for (auto it : ans)
        cout << it << " ";
    cout << "\n";
    return 0;
}
